 Use of Force Options Policy: 
 II.C: Officers will de-escalate and use Force Mitigation principles whenever possible and appropriate,
 before resorting to force and to reduce the need for force.
 
 III.A: When involved in a potential use of force incident or taking police action requiring the use of force, Department members will determine if the seriousness of the situation requires an immediate response or whether the member can employ other force options, including creating more time and distance between the subject and others.
 B. Department members shall de-escalate and use Force Mitigation principles at the earliest possible
 moment.
 C. If the Department member is responding to an incident involving persons in need of mental health
 treatment, the member will act in accordance with the Department directive entitled _Responding to
 Incidents Involving Persons In Need Of Mental Health Treatment,_ including using every possible
 means to verbally de-escalate the situation before resorting to the use of equipment, physical
 restraints, or other use of force options.
 D. Continual Communication
 1. Members will use de-escalation and verbal control techniques in an attempt to reduce
 confrontations prior to, during, and after the use of physical force.
 2. Whenever reasonable, members will exercise persuasion, advice, and warning prior to the
 use of physical force.
 3. The goal of continual communication is to establish and maintain verbal communication in all
 police-public encounters where the member continually evaluates the effectiveness of that
 communication. Members will:
 a. when practical, establish and maintain one-on-one communication where only one
 member speaks at a time.
 b. vary the level of assertiveness of their communication depending on the type of
 police-public encounter. This may range from:
 (1) respectful queries in a preliminary investigation where there is not yet a
 determination a crime has occurred; through
 (2) forceful commands where a serious crime has been committed or life or
 property is at risk.
 4. When encountering non-compliance to lawful verbal direction, members are not compelled to
 take immediate police action through the use of force. Except in the case of preservation of
 life or property, members will consider:
 a. changing their verbal communication techniques to discover a more effective method.
 b. requesting additional personnel to respond or making use of the specialized units
 and equipment available through a notification to OEMC.
 NOTE: Members will, when practical, request assistance from specialized
 units, including a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) trained officer in
 accordance with the Department directive entitled _Responding to
 Incidents Involving Persons In Need Of Mental Health
 Treatment._
 c. if available, allowing a different member to initiate verbal communications.
 NOTE: If a different member initiates verbal communications, then that
 member will seek to establish their own independent one-on-one
 communication. Members should refrain from giving simultaneous
 directions to avoid potential conflicts.
 E. Time as a Tactic
 1. Members may use time as a tactic, making advantageous use of time, distance, and cover by
 isolating and containing a subject and continuously evaluating the member_s positioning and
 force options.
 2. In order to use time as a tactic, a zone of safety should be established for the security of
 responding officers and members of the public. The zone of safety is where:
 a. the incident scene has been secured;
 b. the subject does not pose a continuing threat to Department members or the public;
 and
 c. the scene and subject can be continually monitored, secured, and contained through
 the resolution of the incident.
 3. Using time as a tactic may permit the de-escalation of emotions, as well as the arrival of
 additional Department members and tactical resources.",0,"No.

 (windpipe) or airway (the front of the neck) with the intention of reducing the intake of air.
 (2) Holding and control techniques involving contact with the neck, but which are not intended to reduce the intake of air, are not defined as chokeholds.
 (3) Under no circumstances will a member use a chokehold, or any lesser contact with the neck area, to prevent the destruction of evidence by ingestion.",0,"No.
 Intervening and reporting are described as two of many potential actions officers may take when witnessing excessive force, but there is no explicit requirement that officers do both.
 E. All Department members are obligated to ensure compliance with all laws and Department regulations. If a member knows that another Department member is using excessive force against a subject, the member will take appropriate action. The action required by the member will depend upon the circumstances of the incident. However, appropriate actions may include, but are not limited to, verbal or physical intervention, immediate notification to a supervisor, or a direct order by a supervisor to cease the use of excessive force.",0,No.,1,"Yes

 a. To effect an arrest or to prevent the escape from custody of an arrested person unless he knows that the arrest is unauthorized; or
 b. To defend him self or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force while effecting or attempting to affect such an arrest or while preventing or attempting to prevent such an escape.
 2. A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person for a purpose specified in subsection (1) of this section only when he reasonably believes that it is necessary:
 a. To defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force; or
 b. To affect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he reasonably believes:
 1. Has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon; or
 2. Is attempting to escape by the use of a deadly weapon; or
 3. Otherwise indicates, except through a motor vehicle violation, that he is likely to endanger human life or to inflict serious bodily injury to another unless apprehended without delay. (The Denver Police Department policy on use of deadly force in this situation is more restrictive than state law _ see OMS 105.05(5).
 ...
 4. For the purposes of this section a reasonable belief that a person has committed an offense means a reasonable belief in facts or circumstances which if true would in law constitute an offense. If the believed facts and circumstances would not in law constitute an offense, an erroneous though not unreasonable belief that the law is otherwise does not render justifiable the use of force to make an arrest or to prevent an escape from custody. A peace officer who is affecting an arrest pursuant to a warrant is justified in using the physical force prescribed in subsection (1) and (2) of this section unless the warrant is invalid and is known by the officer to be invalid.""
 b. The community expects and the Denver Police Department requires that peace officers use only the force necessary to perform their duties. The level of force applied must reflect the totality of circumstances surrounding the immediate situation.

 De-Escalation section including Tactical withdrawals and verbal advisements.
 DE-ESCALATION
 Policing requires that at times an officer must exercise control of a violent or resisting subject to make an arrest, or to protect the officer, other officers, or members of the community from risk of imminent harm. Clearly, not every potential violent confrontation
 can be de-escalated, but officers do have the ability to impact the direction and the outcome of many situations they handle, based on their decision-making and the tactics they choose to employ.
 When reasonable under the totality of circumstances, officers should gather information about the incident, assess the risks, assemble resources, attempt to slow momentum, and communicate and coordinate a response. In their interaction with subjects, officers should use advisements, warnings, verbal persuasion, and other tactics and alternatives to higher levels of force. Officers should recognize that they may withdraw to a position that is tactically more secure or allows them greater distance in order to consider or deploy a greater variety of Force Options.

 210.46 EMPLOYEE'S DUTY TO REPORT MISCONDUCT. The reporting of misconduct and prevention of the escalation of misconduct are areas that demand an employee to exercise courage, integrity, and decisiveness. Department Manual Section 3/813.05 requires that when an employee, at any level, becomes aware of possible misconduct by another member of this Department, the employee shall immediately report the incident to a supervisor or directly to Internal Affairs Group. Furthermore, an employee who observes serious misconduct shall take appropriate action to cause the misconduct to immediately cease. The fact that a supervisor is present and not taking appropriate action to stop the misconduct does not relieve other employees present from this obligation.
 
 An employee's obligation to report and prevent misconduct begins the moment the employee becomes a member of the Los Angeles Police Department. Police officers, because of their status as peace officers, have an even greater responsibility to report and prevent misconduct. Experience, rank, or tenure are not factors in knowing the difference between right and wrong, and they do not provide an excuse for failing to take appropriate action. Although supervisors are responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct, all Department employees are responsible for preventing and reporting misconduct.
 
 The citizens of Los Angeles expect and deserve employees who possess a high degree of integrity. Any employee who is perceived, justifiably or not, to be condoning or concealing misconduct impairs the trust of the public. Employees must respect and be aware of their responsibility to freely and truthfully report all acts of misconduct and to act, if necessary, to prevent the escalation of those acts. This is essential if the Department is to maintain the trust of the public.

 Officers allowed to fire on moving vehicle in ""exigent circumstances""
 
 Shooting At or From Moving Vehicles. Firearms shall not be discharged at a moving vehicle unless a person in the vehicle is immediately threatening the officer or another person with deadly force by means other than the vehicle. The moving vehicle itself shall not presumptively constitute a threat that justifies an officer's use of deadly force. An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall move out of its path instead of discharging a firearm at it or any of its occupants. Firearms shall not be discharged from a moving vehicle, except in exigent circumstances and in the immediate defense of life.
 Note: It is understood that the policy in regards to discharging a firearm at or from a moving vehicle may not cover every situation that may arise. In all situations, Department
 members are expected to act with intelligence and exercise sound judgment, attending to
 the spirit of this policy. Any deviations from the provisions of this policy shall be
 examined rigorously on a case by case basis. The involved officer must be able to
 articulate clearly the reasons for the use of deadly force. Factors that may be considered
 include whether the officer's life or the lives of others were in immediate peril and there
 was no reasonable or apparent means of escape.",0,"No.

 245.05 REPORTABLE NONCATEGORICAL
 USE OF FORCE
 INCIDENTS.
 Defined. A reportable use of force incident is classified, per the Consent Decree, as either Categorical or Non Categorical. Categorical uses of force are outlined in Manual Section 3/794.10. All other reportable uses of force, including the discharge of a TASER or use of
 a chemical irritant control device, are classified
 as Non-Categorical use of force incidents.
 Exception: Under any circumstances, the
 discharge of a less-lethal projectile weapon
 (e.g., beanbag shogun, TASER, 37mm or 40mm projectile launcher, any chemical control dispenser or Compressed Air Projectile
 System) that does not contact a person is not reportable as a Non-Categorical use of force.
 Instead, such incidents shall be reported on an Employee_s Report, Form 15.7.
 A reportable Non-Categorical use of force is defined as an incident in which any on-duty Department employee, or off-duty employee whose occupation as a Department employee is a factor, uses a less-lethal control device or
 physical force to:
 _ Compel a person to comply with the
 employee's direction; or,
 _ Overcome resistance of a person during an
 arrest or a detention; or,
 _ Defend any individual from an aggressive
 action by another person;
 
 The following incidents are not reportable as a
 Non-Categorical use of force:
 _ The use of a C-grip, firm grip, or joint lock
 to compel a person to comply with an
 employee_s direction which does not result
 in an injury or complained of injury;
 _ The use of force reasonable to overcome passive resistance due to physical disability,
 mental illness, intoxication, or muscle rigidity of a person (e.g., use of a C-grip or firm grip, joint lock, joint lock walk down or body weight) which does not result in an
 injury or complained of injury;

 Effective Date: 09/01/2015
 
 1. When Safe under the Totality of the Circumstances and Time and Circumstances Permit, Officers Shall Use De-Escalation Tactics in Order to Reduce the Need for Force
 
 De-escalation tactics and techniques are actions used by officers, when safe and without compromising law enforcement priorities, that seek to minimize the likelihood of the need to use force during an incident and increase the likelihood of voluntary compliance. (See Section 8.050.)
 
 When safe and feasible under the totality of circumstances, officers shall attempt to slow down or stabilize the situation so that more time, options and resources are available for incident resolution.
 
 When time and circumstances reasonably permit, officers shall consider whether a subject_s lack of compliance is a deliberate attempt to resist or an inability to comply based on factors including, but not limited to:
 
 * Medical conditions
 
 * Mental impairment
 
 * Developmental disability
 
 * Physical limitation
 
 * Language barrier
 
 * Drug interaction
 
 * Behavioral crisis
 
 An officer_s awareness of these possibilities, when time and circumstances reasonably permit, shall then be balanced against the facts of the incident facing the officer when deciding which tactical options are the most appropriate to bring the situation to a safe resolution.
 
 Mitigating the immediacy of threat gives officers time to utilize extra resources, and increases time available to call more officers or specialty units.
 
 The number of officers on scene may increase the available force options and may increase the ability to reduce the overall force used.
 
 Other examples include:
 
 * Placing barriers between an uncooperative subject and an officer
 
 * Containing a threat
 
 * Moving from a position that exposes officers to potential threats to a safer position
 
 * Decreasing the exposure to potential threat by using
 
 - Distance
 
 - Cover
 
 - Concealment
 
 * Communication from a safe position intended to gain the subject_s compliance, using:
 
 - Verbal persuasion
 
 - Advisements
 
 - Warnings
 
 * Avoidance of physical confrontation, unless immediately necessary (for example, to protect someone, or stop dangerous behavior)
 
 * Using verbal techniques, such as Listen and Explain with Equity and Dignity (LEED) Training, to calm an agitated subject and promote rational decision making
 
 * Calling extra resources to assist or officers to assist:
 
 - More officers
 
 - CIT officers
 
 - Officers equipped with less-lethal tools
 
 * Any other tactics and approaches that attempt to achieve law enforcement objectives by gaining the compliance of the subject",1,"Yes

The moving vehicle itself shall not presumptively constitute a threat that justifies an officer_s use of deadly force.
 
 An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of its path instead of discharging a firearm at it or any of its occupants.
 
 Officers shall not discharge a firearm from a moving vehicle unless a person is immediately threatening the officer or another person with deadly force.

In all situations, Department members are expected to act with intelligence and exercise sound judgment, attending to the spirit of this policy and to the Department_s use-of-force principles. Any deviations from the provisions of this policy shall be examined rigorously on a case-by-case basis. The involved officers must be able to articulate clearly the reasons for the use of deadly force.

 * Whether the officer_s life or the lives of others were in immediate peril
 
 * And if there was no reasonable or apparent mean of escape",1,"Yes
